SOP for Deploying a Flask Application on AWS
Purpose:
This document outlines the process of setting up and running a Flask application on an AWS EC2 instance, including accessing the instance via SSH, importing files from a Git repository, installing requirements, setting up Python, configuring the application with systemctl, enabling it to run at system startup, and opening port 8080 in the firewall.
Materials and Tools Needed:
⦁	AWS account
⦁	SSH key for accessing the instance
⦁	Git repository containing the application files
⦁	requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies (git)
⦁	Access to a terminal or SSH client
⦁	Port 22 open in inbound (SSH)
⦁	.Env file ( Secert  keys)
Procedure:
⦁	Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH:
Linux client : 
1-Open an SSH client.
2-Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is ebenhamu.pem
3-Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
chmod 400 "<RSA>.pem"
4-Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ssh -i "<RSA>.pem" ubuntu@ec2-<IP>.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Windows client :
1- Open client ( Power shell command)
2 -  ssh ubuntu@<IP> -i ~/Downloads/<RSA>.pem

⦁	Import Application Files from Git Repository:
sh
sudo apt update -y && apt upgrade
sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/MayElbaz18/MoniTHOR--Project
cd MoniTHOR--Project
⦁	Install Application Requirements:
            Install Python if not already installed:
sh
sudo apt install python3 -y 
sudo apt install python3-pip

            Install dependencies from requirements.txt:           
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

copy .env file to MoniTHOR--Project folder 



⦁	

⦁	start application
sudo chmod -R 777 .
PYTHON3 APP.PY
⦁	
⦁	Create a Service File for the Application:
sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/MoniTHOR.service
⦁	Add the following content to the file:
ini
[Unit]
Description=MoniTHOR instance, Flask application for domains monitoring
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/MoniTHOR--Project
Environment="/home/ubuntu/MoniTHOR--Project/.env"
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/MoniTHOR--Project/app.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
⦁	Start and Enable the Application with systemctl:
sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start MoniTHOR.service
sudo systemctl enable MoniTHOR.service
⦁	Open Ports in the Firewall:
⦁	stop firewall : sudo systemctl stop ufw   
⦁	optional instead of stoping firewall :
 Use the AWS Management Console to open port 8080
⦁	if port 8080 is not open : Navigate to EC2 -> Security Groups -> Select the Security Group -> Add a new Inbound Rule for HTTP with port 8080.
Verification and Approval:
⦁	After completing the process, verify that the application is running and accessible via the browser at: http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080.

Automated Install:
put .env file in place (/home/ubuntu)
run in terminl the commend: "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MayElbaz18/MoniTHOR--Project/refs/heads/main/monithor.sh | sh"
